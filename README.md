# ju4ja - Julia for Java.
This project aims to makes java programs easier to call julia functions.
Java, along with its bro languages such as Scala, really sucks at numerical computing. Projects like Spark, Breeze, ND4j, Common-math and Optimizer made great efforts to facilitate numerical computing in JVM ecosystem. However, the whole Java community actually lag extremely behind Python and Julia with regard to numerical computing and machine learning. Developers and scientists using Java and Scala have been struggling to push Java into such arena, but it ultimately turns out that Java lacks floating point accuracy, performance, as well as enthusiasm, towards mathematical computation.
